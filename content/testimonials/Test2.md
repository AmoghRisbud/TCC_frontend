quote: "My experience over the last four months working with The Collective Counsel 
has been a very enriching one. I was immediately taken in and I was guided 
through by our National Head and this saw me grow both personally and 
professionally. 
My experience in the Membership and Outreach department has taught me a lot 
of new information and has exposed me to individuals in the same field which 
has been invaluable. I would always get support and advice whenever I 
encountered any problems by the team and the core board. 
My experience as a volunteer in this organisation has also provided me with a 
chance to participate in different workshops and seminars which has contributed 
in a great way to my learning and exposure. 
Altogether, my experience with The Collective Counsel has been incredible, and 
I am happy to be a member of it."
