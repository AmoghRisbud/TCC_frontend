quote: "Being part of The Collective Counsel, especially as the Head of the Membership & Outreach 
Department, has been one of the most transformative experiences of my journey. A platform like 
this has taught me so much more than traditional classrooms or internships could. Through constant 
coordination, communication, and community engagement, I have refined many essential skills like 
time management, leadership, team collaboration, and structural planning. This work, in close 
association with the enthusiastic working body and interaction with the passionate first-generation 
lawyers and law students all over the country, strengthened my confidence and sense of 
responsibility. Every task, from member onboarding to the Campus Ambassador Program, has 
shaped me into being someone more disciplined, aware, and aligned with the service-oriented style 
of leadership. 
What makes The Collective Counsel uniquely remarkable is its purpose and vision. As an initiative 
by first-generation lawyers for first-generation lawyers and law students, it stands as a much needed 
initiative in the legal ecosystem. It is not just an organization; it is a movement; a safe, supportive, 
and inspiring space wherein those without legacy, networks, or guidance are given the opportunity 
to grow, learn, and be heard. Being a 2nd year student myself, this has helped me to grow and lot 
and I am grateful that I could help it to grow as well. I'm proud to be part of this initiative, and I 
hold very dear all the lessons, experiences, and relationships provided to me through it.rooting for 
more success and heights to be achieved by The Collective Counsel."
